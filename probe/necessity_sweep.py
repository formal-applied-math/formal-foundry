"""necessity_sweep — drive the necessity prober (backlog item R) over a whole corpus.

`strengthen.py` answers "is this hypothesis needed by this theorem?" for one candidate
inside the pipeline's gate phase. This module asks the same question of an entire
library, offline, with no pipeline and no model calls: it loads catalogued entries,
triages their binders, and records one verdict per binder.

Positives are certified — the reduced statement was proved and re-gated. Negatives are
not: the prover here is a fixed eight-tactic sweep, so "not closed" means "not shown
unnecessary", never "necessary". Every consumer of this data must preserve that.
